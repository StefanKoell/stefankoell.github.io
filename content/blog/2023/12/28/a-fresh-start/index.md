This is the first blog post on an "old" blog. It's a fresh start. I got rid of all the old content and started over. Now focusing on something different: more C# and more UI - specifically AvaloniaUI.

## Old Content
In the past, I used to blog about monitoring (System Center Operations Manager) and topics around DevOps. I ran the System Center User Group in Austria for 10+ years, also helped organizing conferences and spoke at conferences around the world. I've been a Microsoft MVP for 10 consecutive years. 

My previous web site was wordpress based and kind of a hassle to maintain. I decided to start over and get rid of all the old content. If you are one of those 3 people on this planet who still is interested in ancient old System Center related content, please use the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20231112233101/https://code4ward.net/) to look it up.

## New Content
A couple of topics I plan to address here:

### Hugo
I'm not only ditching all my old wordpress based content, I also use a different way to publish my web site and blog posts. I'm learning to use [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and might share a couple of things here.

### C# and .NET
I love the language. I love the fact that it became available on almost all the platforms I care about.

### Avalonia
[Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/) is my UI framework of choice. It's considered the successor of WPF. Since Microsoft wasn't really able to pull off a decent UI framework in years, Avalonia seems to check all the boxes for me.

### WinForms?
I know that WinForms is quite old but it's still relevant and I still use it a lot. Thanks to a great 3rd party eco-system, you can write decent Windows apps. [Royal TS for Windows](https://royalapps.com/ts/win/features) is such an app and I'm really proud of what I've accomplished.

### The Rest
There may still be the one or the other DevOps related blog post. Maybe also something around PowerShell or other languages and frameworks.

## Expactations
To be honest, I don't know what to expect. I do have plans to write once a week or at least every two weeks. Let's see how it goes...
